                Rap is a musical style that involves rhythmic and rhyming speech over a beat. It originated in the 1970s in the Bronx, New York, as a key element of hip-hop culture. Rap focuses on lyrical storytelling, often addressing social issues, personal experiences, or expressing emotions with wordplay and flow. It is characterized by its unique cadence, rhyming schemes, and delivery. Rap has evolved into various subgenres, including trap, gangsta rap, conscious rap, and mumble rap, with influential artists such as Tupac, The Notorious B.I.G., Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, and Jay-Z shaping its history.
